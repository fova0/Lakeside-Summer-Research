## 07/12: Combining Sea Ice Data and Studying Air Temperatures :)
Hello!

It was a busy third day of LSRI today. Our group took some time to improve the readability of our data by making graphs, interpreting them, and comparing findings. For instance, I worked on finishing up our Sea Ice Graphs from yesterday and was responsible for studying our air temperature data and converting it into line graphs. The following are the steps I took to arrive at our final Mean Monthly Air Temperature line graphs:
* Transferred the data we were provided with from Github to Google Sheets
* Made 12 graphs with the y-axis in years spanning from 1979 to 2022 and an x-axis of air temperature.
   * Each graph represented a month (January through December)
   * Each graph had three lines each representing the three different regions of the Antarctic we are studying (Wedell, Bellingshuasen, and East Antarctic)
* Consolidated the graphs to seasonal ones (Months of October, April, July, January)

I learned that sea surface temperature can be dictated by the combination of air temperatures and wind speeds, so these graphs were mainly important. when compared to our sea ice area graphs

When compared to the sea ice area graphs, our findings aligned as Bellingshuasen was seen to have the least amount of sea ice across and  had a hotter mean air temperature across all months compared to our two other regions. This helped us confirm that air temperature is key to sea ice production.

Due to my lack of experience in Python and the intuitive nature of Google Sheets, I've been using the latter platform for most of the graph creation process and thus have grown significantly in my Google Sheets skills.

Our next steps will definitely be to finalize all our line charts---especially those for average sea surface temperature (SST) and UV Wind Speeds.

Connecting all the different graphs as a group and taking notes on all our conclusions will be important by the end of this week to determine exactly what we want to investigate with the rest of our time here at LSRI.

I personally still need to read the following links Ms. Howard referred me to yesterday so I'll say that's a top priority for me to complete tomorrow.

I'll update you tomorrow!

Let's talk about the graphs tomorrow and we can talk through them and you can tell me what you see in them.

## 07/11: A Day of Data Organization & Graph Making
Hi, again!

For our second day at LSRI my group and I focused on interpreting the data we've been reffered to by Ms. Howard and Dr. Town. 
Since we are focusing on three regions of the Antarctic in our exploration of sea ice--Elsa and I picked one area, The East Antarctic, to delve into. First we looked at the Monthly Average Sea Ice Area in this area over the years of 1979 through 2022. 

Here is the progress we made in short steps:
* Sorted the data by month
* Took the mean of each months Average Sea Ice Area to have a baseline value of Sea Ice Levels for each Month
* Sorted by Year
* Subtracted each months average Sea Ice Area from our Mean Sea Ice Area to find the "Error Rate" where each month differed in the expected Sea Ice Area.

Now, we've set ourselves up to interpret our findings in the coming days. We're hoping to identify strange years or months to further inspect by looking at the highest/lowest peaks in our Error Graphs.

Here are some definitions I missed in my last entry that could be helpful:
* **Antarctica** is a continent surrounded by an ocean which freezes to become sea ice.
Your daily log book should include the following contents:

* **Sea ice** forms when water temperature in the ocean drops below the freezing point of saltwater, about 28.8 °F.
  * Sea ice keeps the polar regions cool and helps moderate global climate.
    
* **El Niño and La Niña (ENSO)** are climate patterns in the Pacific Ocean that can affect weather worldwide.
  * El Niño’s changes to tropical atmospheric circulation lead to a large-scale atmospheric wave, these are called Rossby Waves. These waves
   lead to alternating patterns of high-pressure and low-pressure areas, which have impacts across the world.
  * El Niño presents the Amundsen Sea with higher than normal pressure and wind thus carries warmer, moister air to the Antarctic resulting 
    in more snow. That said, it also results in the upwelling of the Circumpolar Deep Water which melts and thins ice shelves from below 
    which is incredibly dangerous as the collapse of ice shelves accelerate the Antarctic Peninsula’s contribution to sea-level rise.
  * La Niña, on the other hand, brings in cooler, drier air which--while meaning less snow--does prevent harmful upwelling.

Our next steps as the Sea Ice Group are to turn the most interesting pieces of data into interpretable graphs so we can begin drawing some conclusions or informing ourselves on new, interesting directions to explore!

Thanks for reading :)

Great documentation on your steps for production your means, as well as definitions.  I added some papers - take a look at them, it might help with next steps, and give you ideas of the plots you might want to make.

One comment - we refer to what you called the "error Rate" as the anomaly : https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/global-temperature-anomalies

## 07/10: My First Day at LSRI!
Hello! 
Welcome to my first log in this daily logbook
On the first day of LSRI, my questions mainly focused on the background knowledge I would need to be successful in my team's research of Antarctic Sea Ice.

Here is the Antarctic Sea Ice team I am excited to be a part of:
Elsa A. ('24)
Swaraag S. ('25)
Rohan D. ('25)

Here are a few of my inquiries:
* Will the variability of the ENSO cycle contribute to the data anomalies we're trying to identify?

* Why has info on sea ice levels over time been so chaotic? What is causing this fluctuation?

* How come global warming and the general increase in temperature in Antarctica don't immediately dictate sea ice level decay, considering that warmth is often correlated with melting?
  
Some of my questions got answered, some were only partly solved, and others remain a mystery. That said, a couple of conclusions/answers I came upon was that weather patterns have been consistently changing through El Nino/El Nina (ENSO) and other events, which then correlate to the ever-changing state of sea ice in the Antarctic. Additionally, sea ice growth/stability is less dictated by "global warming" as a general idea of heat but rather by our wind temperatures and what type of weather is presenting itself. For instance, during El Nino, Rossby Waves bring in moist warm air to the Western region of Antarctica. This air is great for generating snow but has the downside of its wind direction, causing upwelling in the Circumpolar Deep Water. This upwelling melts and thins the deeper, thicker ice shelves from below. Ice shelves are incredibly important as their collapse by melting will ultimately accelerate the Antarctic Peninsula’s contribution to sea-level rise.

For the rest of my time here at LSRI, it looks like I'll be communicating with my group what we think our next steps and responsibilities should look like! We have quite a few research questions, so it's an important next step we take the time to come to a mutual understanding of where our research will end up going and what goals we have.

That's all for this entry! Thanks for reading :)
Best,
Eva

This is a good start thinking about where you headed with this research theme. The lines of inquiries seem interesting but not exactly what you mean by "Why has info on sea ice levels over time been so chaotic? What is causing this fluctuation?"  lets discuss this more tomorrow.  But I think you are thinking correctly.  it might be a good idea to get some definitions down - for things like Rossby waves, El Nino/La Nina, etc.  Upwelling incredibly important, so it is important to understand that process.
Great work!
